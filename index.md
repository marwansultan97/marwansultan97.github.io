  # 👋 Hi, I’m Marwan - I’m a Senior iOS Developer

  As a Senior iOS Developer with 5+ years of experience, I design and build scalable, high-quality iOS applications using Swift, SwiftUI, and UIKit.  
  I focus on clean architecture, modular systems, and performance-driven solutions, delivering reliable products for both enterprise and consumer use.

  Outside of work, I enjoy playing padel and football, going to the gym, and staying active, which helps me maintain focus and discipline in my professional life.
