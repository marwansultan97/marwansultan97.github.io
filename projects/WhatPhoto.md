## 🧩 Overview {#overview}

**AtWork** is a creative iOS application that enables users to transform ideas into visually rich artwork using AI. Users can generate images through text prompts, reference images, or voice memos—making the creative process fast, flexible, and accessible.

The app allows users to refine generated artwork with captions and control the final output by selecting custom aspect ratios optimized for social media platforms, print formats, or personal use. Monetization is handled through in-app purchases, offering premium access to advanced generation capabilities.
