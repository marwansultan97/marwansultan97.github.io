## 🧩 Overview {#overview}

**CaptionAI** is an AI-powered iOS application designed for content creators to generate subtitles, record short-form videos, and produce polished final outputs directly on their device. The app automatically detects the spoken language in videos and generates subtitles using advanced AI transcription models.

Inspired by workflows used in platforms like YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels, CaptionAI allows users to record multiple short video clips and seamlessly combine them into a single video—while maintaining full control over subtitles, timing, and visual styling.
